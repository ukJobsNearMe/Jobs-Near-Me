<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone looking for a job, you know just how important networking can be. But with the way the world has changed, you may be wondering how to network effectively when so many events and gatherings have been cancelled. Here are some tips that can help you make the most of your networking opportunities, both online and off, both online and offline.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Participate in social media by getting active on it</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to network in 2020 is by being active on social media. The LinkedIn platform is a great way for you to network with other professionals in your industry in addition to staying up to date on news and trends in your field. There is also Twitter, which is a great platform for networking, especially if you follow relevant hashtags and participate in industry-specific chats that take place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn't enough to be active on social media, but you should also ensure that your online presence is up to standard as well. The best way to accomplish this would be to use a professional headshot as your profile picture and to make sure that your resume and contact information are as easily accessible as possible from your profile page. If you are concerned about your privacy while searching for a job, you can always create a separate email address that you only use for professional correspondence during your job search.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be a part of virtual events</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that in-person events have been cancelled, there are still plenty of opportunities to network despite the cancellation of the in-person events. This year, quite a few conferences and networking events will be held virtually, so there is no excuse not to take part in them. You can usually find a list of upcoming virtual events by doing a quick Google search or by checking out relevant groups. As a professional, you will not only benefit from participating in virtual events, but you will also have the opportunity to expand your professional network as well as stay up-to-date on trends in your field and learn more about your industry as a whole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reach Out Individually</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not uncommon to find virtual events or online communities that are relevant to your industry that are difficult to find, so don't be afraid to reach out and connect with people individually if you need help. As a start, you might consider reaching out to people you already know - former coworkers, classmates, family members, etc. You might want to talk to them about your job search as well as asking if they know anyone who could be able to help you. If you have exhausted your personal network, you might consider cold messaging people whose work you admire or who work for companies you want to work for in the future. There is no worse thing they can do than say no.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keep track of your contacts by following up with them</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important thing to remember is to follow up on any contact you have made with someone once you have made that contact. You should use email, phone and LinkedIn as appropriate. Make sure you do not annoy people by being too persistent in your follow-ups.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It would be nice if we could talk about something other than work</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you ask them about their hobbies, interests, family, etc. It would be great if you were able to find something in common that interests you. The most effective way to get them to talk to you about their hobbies and interests is to ask them questions about those topics. If they ask what you do for fun or what's going on in your life, try not to tell them that you are unemployed. Let them know that instead of making an excuse about how unemployed you are, tell them something interesting that has nothing to do with being unemployed or just say something polite like you've been busy without going into too much detail as to why exactly this has taken such a lot of your time lately.</span></p>
